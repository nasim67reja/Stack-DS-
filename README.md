# Stack Implementations in C++, Python, and JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of the stack data structure in three different programming languages: C++, Python, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to showcase how the stack, a fundamental data structure, can be implemented and utilized across different programming paradigms and syntaxes.

## About Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The main operations that can be performed on a stack are:

- **Push:** Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Remove the top element of the stack.
- **Peek:** Get the value of the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty.

## Implementations

This repository includes stack implementations in the following languages:

- **C++:** A static type, compiled language that offers control over memory management.
- **Python:** A dynamic type, interpreted language known for its readability and simplicity.
- **JavaScript:** A dynamic type, interpreted language widely used for web development.

### C++ Implementation

The C++ implementation demonstrates the use of classes and templates to create a generic stack that can handle different data types.

### Python Implementation

The Python implementation showcases the simplicity of using lists to create a dynamic stack without the need for a specific stack class.

### JavaScript Implementation

The JavaScript version utilizes arrays and their methods to implement stack functionality, demonstrating its use in web development scenarios.

## Usage

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific programming language and contains source code files along with example usage. Refer to the README files within each folder for detailed instructions on how to run and test each implementation.
